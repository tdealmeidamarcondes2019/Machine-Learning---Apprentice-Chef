# Machine-Learning---Apprentice-Chef

The objective of this analysis was to build a regression based analysis and a classification-based predictive model using Apprentice Chef database. 

Apprentice Chef is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Their targeted customer is the busy professional with little to no skills in the kitchen, but appreciate a good meal. 

The first analysis (A1) is destined to better understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of orders.

The second analysis (A2) explores which variables impact most for the success of their cross-sell, Halfway There, a promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle with the meal every Wednesday. The objective here is to understand which customer will be more succeptible to purchase this promotion.

In both assignments, we have three different files. <strong> Analysis </strong> comprehend the exploratory process of handling the data to find the build the model and find the business insights. <strong> Model </strong> contains only the code needed to run the final model, giving the respective score. Lastly, <strong> Write_Up </strong> is where we summarized the analysis with the most impactful business insights that we were able to gather from the analysis, followed by an actionable recommendation.
